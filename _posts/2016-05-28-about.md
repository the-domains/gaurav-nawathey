About

SnapShooters Photography, started in Sep 2015 is a small startup providing professional services in Commercial Photography. Primary assignments are Weddings, Ring Ceremonies and Engagements; but off late we have also ventured in portfolio shoots for models, product shoots and architectural & interiors photography assignments.

Our second line of services are conducting professional wildlife safaris across Indian Wilderness to Tiger Reserves & Wetlands like Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Corbett, Tadoba, Ranthambhore & Bharatpur Wildlife Sanctuaries
